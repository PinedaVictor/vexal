# `./pkg`

The `pkg` directory, used to organize packages that are meant for public consumption.

Reusability: Packages within the pkg directory are designed to be reusable across different projects. They encapsulate functionality that may be useful to others and can be imported into external projects as dependencies.

Public API: Packages in the pkg directory often define the public API of your project. These are the packages that you expect external consumers to interact with and use in their own projects.

Separation of Concerns: By segregating reusable packages into the pkg directory, you separate them from your project-specific code in the internal directory. This helps maintain a clear separation of concerns and promotes modular design.
