"useArea.tsx

This file contains a custom React hook called `useArea` that calculates the area based on the input width and height values. The hook utilizes the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage state and side effects.

The `useArea` function takes two parameters: `initialWidth` and `initialHeight`, which are used to initialize the state variables for width, height, and area. The area is calculated as the product of width and height.

An `useEffect` hook is used to recalculate the area whenever the width or height values change. The `setDimensions` function allows for updating the width and height values, which triggers the recalculation of the area.

The `useArea` hook returns an object with properties `width`, `height`, `area`, and `setDimensions` function to update the dimensions. This custom hook can be imported and used in other components to manage and calculate the area based on the width and height values."
