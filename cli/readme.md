## useArea.tsx

### Functions

The `useArea.tsx` file contains a custom React hook called `useArea`. This hook takes in initial width and height values and returns the current width, height, area (width \* height), and a function to set new dimensions.

The hook uses the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React. It initializes state variables for width, height, and area using `useState` with the initialWidth and initialHeight values. It then calculates the area by multiplying the width and height values in the state.

An `useEffect` hook is used to update the area whenever the width or height values change. The hook listens for changes in the width and height dependencies and recalculates the area accordingly.

The `setDimensions` function is provided to update the width and height values together. This function takes new width and height values as parameters and uses the `useState` setter functions to update the state variables.

The hook returns an object `{ width, height, area, setDimensions }` containing the current width, height, area, and the function to set new dimensions.

The `useArea` hook is exported as the default export from the file, allowing other components to import and use it in their code.
