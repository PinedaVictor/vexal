"file: `useArea.tsx` content: \n\nThe `useArea` file contains a custom React hook named `useArea` that calculates the area of a rectangle based on the width and height inputs. The hook initializes `width`, `height`, and `area` states using the `useState` hook with the initial width and height values. \n\nAn `useEffect` hook is used to update the `area` state whenever the `width` or `height` state changes. \n\nThe `setDimensions` function is defined to update the `width` and `height` states when called with new width and height values. \n\nThe hook returns an object with the `width`, `height`, `area`, and `setDimensions` functions, which can be used to track and update the dimensions of the rectangle. The `useArea` hook can be imported and used in other components to calculate and manage the area of rectangles."
