"useArea.tsx

This file contains a custom hook `useArea` which takes initial width and height as parameters and returns the current width, height, area, and a function to set new dimensions. 

The `useArea` function utilizes the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks from React to manage the state of width, height, and area. The initial values of width, height, and area are set using `useState`. 

The `useEffect` hook is used to recalculate the area whenever the width or height is changed. 

The `setDimensions` function allows for setting new width and height values, which in turn update the area. 

Finally, the `useArea` custom hook returns an object with the current width, height, area, and the `setDimensions` function.

Developers can import and use this custom hook to easily manage the area calculation for components in their React application."
