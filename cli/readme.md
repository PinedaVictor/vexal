"# ztest

This file is an Express server set up with four different routes (\"/\", \"/service\", \"/serviceB\", \"/service3\") that all return a JSON response with the message `{ sup: true }` and a status code of 200. The server is listening on port 8080 and logs a message to the console when it starts.

Relevant Functions:
- `app.get(route, callback)`: The `app.get()` function is used to define routes that the server will respond to with the specified callback function.
- `app.listen(port, callback)`: The `app.listen()` function starts the server and listens on the specified port for incoming requests.

Code Logic:
1. Import the Express framework and define the server app.
2. Set the port to 8080.
3. Define four different routes that respond with a JSON message and status code of 200.
4. Start the server and log a message to the console indicating that the server is listening on port 8080."
